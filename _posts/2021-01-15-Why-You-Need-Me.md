HiðŸ‘‹  There!, 

You are building a great product, and I love it - I love innovation and disruption. Also, I hope you have a good culture, which one can innovate, grow and learn, at the same time.

If there is, here are the reasons I think you need me for a product manager, product analyst, data analyst/scientist, or business analyst positions. 

* I have almost three years of experience in data analysis, business analysis and product management, and, have two-plus years of experience working with 
Python (scikit-learn, pandas, fastai, PyTorch, numpy), excel (Advance), and SQL(Intermediate). <i>Maybe, many people have these.
* I have two-plus years of startup experience, so I know how to take several responsibilities and make sure the job is complete, delivered, clean, 
whiles keeping an eye on the greater goal. <i> Not made a decision yet? keep going ... </i>
* I have implemented features for a mobile application, which have 1M+ installs and 60K avg monthly users; reduced Cost of Acquisition by 50% whiles increasing lead 
conversion rate and disbursement rate by 30% and 9% respectively MoM using A/B testing techniques.  <i>If this ignites your interest, then maybe check out my 
[CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y5MHeLp_v0wJbVl3sfw6lE7xd3tKaaQE/view?usp=sharing) on how I saved my company some money by optimizing, and led two major system 
integrations and upgrades. </i>
* Aside from all stated above, I have worked on Omdena in using sentiment analysis techniques to classify tweets in solve violence issues in Chicago. 
Also worked in building models to detect water bodies from satellite imagery data in fighting malaria.  <i>Hope you're willing to review now..</i>
* Further, I am Learner, and  I am working on becoming a Machine Learning Engineer or Software Engineer (data & analytics/machine learning), 
as such I have started self-learning in software development (Python), SQL in-depth, cloud infrastructure and others.
* I will add to the diversity of your team and [research](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/diversity-and-inclusion-build-high-performance-teams/) has shown that diversity often makes for a better, more successful team.

If, by now, I have given you a reason to consider why you need me (aside from making sure things are done and customers and business are happy) and I hope I have, then kindly connect via <frederickauthur@hotmail.com>. 
If not, then maybe I am not a good fit for you :).
